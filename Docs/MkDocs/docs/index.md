# Welcome to Appst.IO

This is a collection of .Net libraries I've put together in order to use the [reactive extensions](http://reactivex.io/) library with
serial ports and for the launching of process's

## Libraries

There are several libraries included here:

  * [Appst.Reactive](Appst.Reactive/Overview.md) - A set of base class's for observalbes and observable streams
